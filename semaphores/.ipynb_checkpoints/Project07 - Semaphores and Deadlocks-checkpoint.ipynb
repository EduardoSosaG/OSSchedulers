    "This week, we focus on the concept of a sempahore as a way to synchronize various processes in an efficent way all the while avoiding problems that come from multithreading (such as race conditions). We will implement a simple semaphore and test it against a producer/consumer program created by professor Al Madi. We will then use our semaphores to solve the dining philosopher's problem. "

    "We build our semaphore by implementing an acquire and a release method. The acquire method sleeps a thread if the counter falls below zero and the release method wakes up a thread once the condition variable has been released. We test our function below: We have a place and a remove method implemented by professor Al Madi. The producer and the consumer methods below then place and remove items from a buffer. We expect to see no errors, the buffer size should never exceed ten, and all items should be removed from the buffer at the end of each run. "
