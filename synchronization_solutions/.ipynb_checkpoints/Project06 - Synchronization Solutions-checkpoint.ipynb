    "In this project, we take into account when two or more threads access a critical section. Having two or more threads accessing a critical section is not good practice since it means that multiple threads are making changes to global resources at the same time which leads to race conditions and errors. In this project, we attempt to solve these problems by analyzing whether our proposed solutions have three properties: does the solution guarantee mutual exclusion (only one thread accesses the critical section), is progress being made (only those threads that need access to the critical section can decide who enters it), and bounded wait time (no thread ever starves forever). We propose four solutions and test them for the above properties."

    "First thing we want to do is to create a race condition where we can test our solutions to see if they can solve some of the problems that can arise from multiple threads accessing the same resource. The below code was kindly given to me by professor Al Madi. It creates a race condition when no lock is used (or a lock that violates the mutual exclusion property)."

To do this, we can force a context switch when one of the processes turns their flag to true but before entering the critical section so that the other thread does the same. Now that both threads have their flags set to true and none of them have entered the critical section, none can turn the other flag to false, leading to deadlock. "

    "The bakery solution is special in that not only does it have mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded wait time, but it also can run on many threads. In the following simulations, we will test mutual exclusion using multiple threads so that the nthreads test is also being perfomed. Below, we once again test mutual exclusion by running four threads for 1000 iterations each. This leads to no errors since a race condition is impossible with the bakery solution. This is due to the use of flags and tickets that allow processes to take turns and not starve all while preserving progress. "

    "As we saw, solution one seems like a great idea in that it attempts to establish order in the way that threads execute. However, it fails progress if a thread finishes early. Solution two fixes that, but fails if there is a context switch at the wrong time as we saw earlier in our simulation. This leads to a deadlock and therefore starvation among the threads. Peterson's solution further improves on these solutions and fixes bounded waiting time. However, as we saw in class, Peterson's solution fails for more than two threads. Bakery Solution goes ahead and then fixes all components for n-threads, thereby making Bakery's Solution the superior solution over all other solutions. "
